Watching the five new episodes that comprise Tiger King 2, one is reminded
that, sometimes, you can never go back. In March 2020, when humanity was
freshly stuck inside due to the global pandemic lockdowns, the arrival of
Netflixâ€™s Tiger King docuseries was the trashy distraction we all needed.
But now in November 2021, with the pandemic still killing way too many
people and humanity beyond weary of being caged inside our homes, Tiger
King 2, as they say, hits different.

As a refresher, Tiger King was the sordid, tabloidy expose of Joe Exotic,
the owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma. With his
bleached mullet, terrible self-produced music videos, and rickety zoo housing
a variety of abandoned animals, including big cats, Exotic came across like
a modern day, white trash P.T. Barnum. But in the course of the doc narrative,
the carnival sideshow aspect got dark with his bizarre obsession and hate for
rival conservationist Carole Baskin.
